# 00 - START HERE

The front door of this vault. Everything else is reachable from here.

## What this vault is for

This vault holds analyses. You hand over documents, source code, or both; a set of plain-language notes comes back — what the material says, what it actually does, how the parts fit together, pictures of how it works, what to build next, and where every task came from.

Every note is written for someone with no technical background. Nothing here needs a developer to translate it.

## Analyses in this vault

| Analysis | What it covers | Started | Last updated |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[ANALYSIS - HOTEL BOOKING SYSTEM/00 - START HERE\|Hotel Booking System]] | The Riverside, a twenty-four room hotel, with four levels of user. A worked example covering every file this analyzer can produce. | 8 August 2026 | 8 August 2026 |

<!-- One row per analysis run. Link the first cell to that run's own 00 - START HERE, like this:
| [[ANALYSIS - PAYROLL APP/00 - START HERE\|Payroll App]] | The payroll system | 5 August 2026 | 5 August 2026 |
-->

## How to start one

Say what you want looked at, and what to call it. For example: *"Analyse the files in this folder — call it the Booking System."*

You can hand over any of these, in any mix:

| What you have | What comes back |
|---|---|
| Documents only — Word, PDF, Markdown, notes, anything written | What the documents say, plus a plan built from them |
| Source code only | What the code actually does, plus a plan built from that |
| Both together | All of the above, plus the most useful part — where the writing and the working files agree, disagree, and leave gaps |

You can also ask for just one piece — *"just the roadmap"*, *"just the diagrams"* — and only that gets made.

And you can ask for more depth on any part of the system — *"write up the parts in detail"* — which adds a page for each one, covering what it does, who may use it, what it checks, and how it behaves when something goes wrong.

Where a system has several levels of user, you can also ask *"what does each role see"*, which maps the screens each level looks at and which parts sit behind them. Neither of these is made unless you ask for it.

## What each analysis contains

Each one lands in its own folder, with files numbered in reading order:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `00 - START HERE` | What was handed over, the index, the legend, and the open questions |
| `01 - OVERVIEW` | What the thing is and what it does |
| `02 - DOCUMENT FINDINGS` | What the documents say |
| `03 - CODE FINDINGS` | What the working files actually do |
| `04 - COMBINED FINDINGS` | Where the two agree and disagree |
| `05 - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE` | The parts and how they hand work along |
| `06 - DIAGRAMS` | The pictures |
| `07 - DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP` | What to build, in what order, and why that order |
| `08 - ROADMAP TRACKER` | Where each item on the plan stands |
| `09 - TASK TRACKER` | Every task and where it came from |
| `10 - WORD LIST` | Plain meanings for the words that could not be avoided |
| `11 - PARTS IN DETAIL` | What each part does and how it behaves — made only when asked for |
| `12 - SCREENS BY ROLE` | What each level of user sees — made only when asked for |

Files that do not apply are not made, and the run's own `00 - START HERE` says why.

## Status legend

The same emojis mean the same things everywhere in this vault.

| Emoji | Means |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Finished — built, checked, working |
| 🟨 | Being worked on right now |
| ⭕ | Not started — waiting its turn |
| ❌ | Blocked — something is stopping it |
| 🔵 | Already there — found in the supplied material, built before this plan |
| ⬜ | Dropped — decided against, kept for the record |
| ❓ | Unclear — the material does not say |

## Two promises these notes keep

**Nothing is invented.** Every statement names where it came from — a document and its page, a file and its line, or a conversation and its date. Where the material does not say, the notes say *we do not know* and put the question in writing rather than filling the gap with something plausible.

**Nothing is hidden behind jargon.** Technical words appear only when they are real names of real things, and each one gets a plain meaning in the word list.
